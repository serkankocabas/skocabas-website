abstract: "This study examines the effect of structural transformation on labor productivity growth in the manufacturing industry in Turkey for the period of 1981-2000. Structural transformation is defined as the movement of the factor inputs of the sector from sectors that have relatively low productivity to sectors that have relatively high labor productivity. The conventional shift-share analysis has been used for the purpose of showing the effect of structural transformation on the rise of labor productivity in the manufacturing sector. The empirical results do not support the structural bonus hypothesis. The empirical findings show that structural transformation is not important in explaining the rise of labor productivity for the period of 1981-2000. Moreover, the structural transformation seems to be a burden rise of labor productivity rather than a bonus in during 1981-2000."
